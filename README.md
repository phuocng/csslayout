# CSS Layout

A collection of popular layouts and patterns made with CSS:

-   🎉 Zero dependencies
-   🎉 No frameworks
-   🎉 No CSS hacks
-   🎉 Real use cases
-   Good practices (coming soon)
-   Accessibility Support (coming soon)

## Why

Being a front-end engineer, I have to deal with a lot of layouts and components.
There are a lot of CSS frameworks out there that provide popular layouts/components but
I usually don't want to include all of them in my project.

So I collect most popular layouts and components that can be built with pure CSS.
They are powered by modern CSS features such as flexbox and grid.

They are great starting points to be picked and customized easily for each specific need.
By composing them, you can have any possible layout that exists in the real life.
